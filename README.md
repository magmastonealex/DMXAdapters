# DMXAdapters
A bunch of small USB->DMX adapters of varying levels of complexity.

EAGLE schematics are:

Schematic using an ATMega328. Could be any Arduino-compatable chip.

NAND.sch

![NAND.sch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magmastonealex/DMXAdapters/master/NAND.png)

Schematic using NAND gates. Really, really bargain-basement FTDI adapter. But it works great!

MAX485.sch

![485.sch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magmastonealex/DMXAdapters/master/MAX485.png)

Schematic using MAX485. The 'right' way to do software DMX.
